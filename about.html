                        I grew up in a middle class family in germany and was living a pretty "normal" life. I wasn't very extroverted or popular. When i was younger i was more interested in computers and video games, but as i grew older i tarted to realize that this wasn't who i wanted to be.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        At the age of 15 my parents divorced. My mentally ill father had physically assaulted my mother. He was sent to a mental institution and she was admitted to hospital. Since then my life completely changed. I went from living in a average middle class family to living alone with my mother off of child support and money from the state. I never wanted pity for what happend. For me it was more of a wake-up call. It changed my perspective on live completely. I valued my life alot more, i wanted to use every second of it. Really i had nothing to loose and wanted to choose how i live and not let anybody tell me what's the "right" way.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        When i was 17 i discovered music for myself. I basically came to making beats, because a friend of mine wanted to rap and i basically said, "i think i could make a beat for you". I knew FL Studio, because i used it for a short period of time when i was younger. Back then i just did a couple songs and completely forgot about it, but this time it was different. I really dug deep and tried to learn everything i could about the programm and music in general. I started making beats and really fell in love with it. Everytime i made a beat wich was better than usual i really got a rush out of it, it is an unbelievable feeling. There also was this one video i porbably watched a hundred times, its the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQu0VBDYqr4">video</a> from Lex Luger where he is producing a beat. I thougth this was so fucking cool and it really inpsired me to do this myself. So i produced non stop for now almost two years. I even got a job on the weekends when i didn't need to go to school just to be able to invest in my craft. Now i believe my beats are good enough to be shown and i hope you enjoy them as much as i enjoy making them.
                    </p>
